# ✨ Features
* 🛒 **Light** Only ONE executable file, it can run smoothly on laptops without GPUs (data files will be created at runtime automatically).
* 🐱‍🏍 **AI powered** Integrated `Huggingface local models (Llama, Phi-3, Gemma, Multilingual E5, MiniLM L6v2, NomicEmbedTextV1_5, etc.)`, `Ollama` and `OpenAI`, this can be used for `Chat`, `Text generation` and `Intent detection`.
* 🚀 **Fast** Built on Rust and Vue3.
* 😀 **Simple** Use the mouse to drag and drop with our intuitive node-based editor.
* 🔐 **Safe** 100% open source, all runtime data is saved locally (Using `OpenAI API` may expose some data).

# Give it a try!
* 🐋 **Docker** We provided an image on Docker Hub at [dialogflowchatbot/demo](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/dialogflowchatbot/demo)
* 💻 **Binary releases**, please check [here](https://github.com/dialogflowchatbot/dialogflow/releases)

> By default application will listen to `127.0.0.1:12715`, you can use `-ip` and `-port` specify new value, e.g.: `dialogflow -ip 0.0.0.0 -port 8888`
